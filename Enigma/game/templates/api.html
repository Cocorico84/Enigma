    <h1>Welcome to the Circle sir. My name is Pat. What is the will of The Crown today?</h1>
    <p>The API investigation department is at your disposal. <br>
        You are allowed to consult all the areas in the archives.<br>
        However, there are very big and you could be easily lost.<br>
        You need a methodology to start the investigation.<br>
        Use the extension of the url to gain access to specific API data.<br>
        You should start to consult the crimes_data by extending the following url: <br>
        https:// + domain/enigma/api/ + "what you search for".<br>
        By mistake or by chance you discovered your own profile saved on the api at "api/detective/int:id/"</p>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-warning" onclick=" relocate_home()"
            style=margin-top:40px;margin-bottom:40px;>Exit from the Circle
    </button>
    <p>Pat:"Sir don't forget that you need an authorization to leave with a file. Remember to leave behind what you
        consulted.</p>
    <p>Pat:"You wouldn't want to be suspected of sedition 'do you? :-)</p>
    <p>Pat:"I wish you a good hunt sir".</p>
